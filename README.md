# Safari_Random_User_Agent
Safari random User Agent


What does this do??
It changes the safari user agent, so that a server on the Internet thinks it is communicating with for ex. a browser like Mozilla FIrefox 3.0 on a Windows NT computer.


Why would I do this?  
If u feel the need to ask this question, don't do it.


Who can use this?
People who use OSX and safari duh.


Notes:  Use .cc if you want to change the code and recompile yourself.
		Add other browsers or remove the ones you dont want from user.agents.txt
